This code is derived from original tensorflow(0.10.0) seq2seq translation model.

Now, beam search has been added to decoding.

Command line for training::

        python translate.py


See in translate.py, there are some default configurations, you can change them by adding '--' commands.

P.S This code is previously tested on Chinese-English translation. But since I cannot provide with the data, I'm now
testing this code on English-French translation.
